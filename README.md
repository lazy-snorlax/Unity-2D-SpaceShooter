# Unity-2D-SpaceShooter
A top down space shooter game using 3D assets and customizable scripts.

## What I learned
- Basics of gameplay mechanics from a developer perspective
- Collision detection using Unity and C#
- Always try to make the necessary gameplay mechanics customizable within the Unity Editor (i.e. Player Speed, Player Life, Enemy Speed)
